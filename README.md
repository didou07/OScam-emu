Building OSCam-Emu from source
==========================

https://git.streamboard.tv/common/oscam/-/wikis/BuildingOscam

For more information and examples on using the build system, please
see README.build and README.config files.


Building OSCam-Emu for different CPUs (cross-compilation)
=====================================================

First you need to install the target CPU toolchain. Already built toolchains
for various architectures can be downloaded from:

    https://git.streamboard.tv/common/oscam/-/wikis/CrossCompiling

In order to cross compile OSCam-Emu you need to set CROSS variable when
running make. For example to compile for SH4 architecture you need
to run: `make CROSS=sh4-linux-` or if your cross compilers are not
in your PATH - `make CROSS=/opt/STM/STLinux-2.3/devkit/sh4/bin/sh4-linux-`.


Dependencies
============

OSCam-Emu by default do not depend on external libraries except when compilation
with SSL is requested. In that case openssl (libcrypto) library must be
installed.

OSCam-Emu supports building with the following external dependencies:
  - libcrypto (libssl) - 'make USE_LIBCRYPTO=1'
  - libusb             - 'make USE_LIBUSB=1'
  - PCSC               - 'make USE_PCSC=1'
  - SH4 STAPI support  - 'make USE_STAPI=1'
  - SH4 STAPI5 support - 'make USE_STAPI5=1'
  - Coolapi support    - 'make USE_COOLAPI=1'
  - AZBOX support      - 'make USE_AZBOX=1'

For STAPI support you need to download liboscam_stapi.a library and place
it in stapi directory under oscam/ root dir.

For STAPI5 support you need to download liboscam_stapi5.a library and place
it in stapi directory under oscam/ root dir.

For more information and examples on using the build system, run `make help`.
